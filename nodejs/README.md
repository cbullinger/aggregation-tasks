# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Study: Node.js Driver

This study will help us learn how you use MongoDB documentation to build aggregation pipelines. 
You will work with the Yelp sample dataset (business and review collections) already loaded in MongoDB Atlas.

This Node.js project contains a series of tasks that require an aggregation pipeline to return the desired data.  
Your job is to write the aggregation pipeline logic in each task file. 
Connection code and data setup are already handled for you.

> **This is not a test of your skill or knowledge.** We want to see how you use our documentation.
> If you feel stuck or confused, that is our responsibility.

## Setup

1. Confirm you have the following, or install if needed (both are required to run the MongoDB Node.js driver):
   - Node.js v16.20.1 or later
   - npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Clone this repository, and navigate to the `nodejs` project root.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cbullinger/aggregation-tasks.git && cd nodejs
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set your `MONGODB_URI` variable to the connection string provided by the moderator.
    You can choose export it as a global var or create a `.env` at the project root.
5. Verify your setup:

   ```bash
    npm run testConnection 
   ```

## Running a Task

To run any task, use:

```bash
npm run task <taskNumeral>
```

For example `npm run task 1`.

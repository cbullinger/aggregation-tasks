## Getting Started

[TODO: Add getting started instructions explaining how to set connection string, start server, start client, etc.]

## Issues

If you have problems running the sample app, please check the following:

- [ ] Verify that you have set your MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file.
- [ ] Verify that you have started the Express server.
- [ ] Verify that you have started the Next.js client.
- [ ] Verify that you have no firewalls blocking access to the server or client ports.

If you have verified the above and still have issues, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/mongodb/docs-sample-apps/issues/new/choose)
on the source repository `mongodb/docs-sample-apps`.
